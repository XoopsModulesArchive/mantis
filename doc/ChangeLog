Mantis ChangeLog

2003.03.22  -  0.18.0a4

2003.02.16  -  0.18.0a1

 This release contains literally hundreds, if not thousands, of changes.
 Upcoming releases will hopefully follow a *much* quicker release cycle now
 that we are back on track.

 This marks the first release of Mantis with a completely refactored API
 library.  All the API files are in the core/ directory should you wish to
 examine them in more detail.  The process of cleaning up the APIs and making
 sure all the pages use them is still not quite complete, but we are getting
 close

 Listing every individual change would be unproductive but the key ones are
 listed or summarized below:

 * Behaviour change: made 'normal' the default priority for new bugs
 * Behaviour change: Merged default/config_inc1.php and default/config_inc2.php in config_inc.php in the main directory
 * Behaviour change: Removed f_ prefix from POST and GET field names
 * Changed config options (*_color): now use $g_status_colors['<status color>'] array. For example, $g_new_color is replaced with $g_status_colors['new'].
 * Changed config options (default_advanced_report, default_advanced_view, default_advanced_update): now ON/OFF instead of BOTH/SIMPLE/ADVANCED (they never worked the other way anyway)
 * Changed config options (login_method): the constant CRYPT_FULL_SALT is now deprecated and should be replaced with CRYPT, which behaves exactly the same, or MD5
 * Code cleanup: added validation checks for all inputs that are passed on to database queries
 * Code cleanup: db_prepare_string(), db_prepare_int(), and db_prepare_bool() to be called on data before it goes into the database
 * Code cleanup: modified input-checked variables to be prefixed by $c_
 * Code cleanup: Moved admin_* scripts into admin/ directory
 * Code cleanup: Moved core_* files into core/ directory, which can be moved out of the webroot
 * Code cleanup: Replaced '/' with DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR throughout to make things cross-platform
 * Code cleanup: Rewrote large parts of Mantis to improve security
 * Copyright transfered by Kenzaburo Ito to 'Mantis Group', consisting of all of Mantis developers, as of 2002. All files have had their copyright notices changed to reflect this.
 * Enhancement: added a button to copy categories from another project, in addition to the current 'copy to'
 * Enhancement: added a direct link, with a small icon, on each bug row, so that users on a selected project can switch directly to the update bug page (simple/advanced depending on user preferences).
 * Enhancement: added a remove link next to the edit link in the project categories and project versions to allow deleting without going into edit.
 * Enhancement: added announcement flag to news.  Announcements are always kept at the top of the news page.
 * Enhancement: admin_check script moved to admin/check.php and rewritten to be more complete
 * Enhancement: added javascript autofocus to the login page
 * Enhancement: added javascript autofocus to the report bug pages
 * Enhancement: added links from the counters of bugs reported and assigned to logged in user to their corresponding filtered view
 * Enhancement: added support for custom_constants_inc.php, if this file is found in main directory it gets included after constants_inc.php.  It is useful to define constants for custom enumerations.
 * Enhancement: added support for custom_strings_inc.php, if this file is found in main directory it gets included after lang/strings_xxxx.php to allow overriding of strings without modifying the language files.  $g_active_language can be used to check the active language.
 * Enhancement: added support for modifying the reporter of a bug
 * Enhancement: Added Word2k and Excel export in print_all_bug_page.php. Users can choose the bugs to display/print, and the fields to export with the 'Printing Options' link.
 * Enhancement: Administrators can now modify the preferences for all users that are not protected.  Protected users need to be unprotected first.
 * Enhancement: allow managers to update project information, change project user list, add/edit/delete categories and versions
 * Enhancement: auto-assign bugs when a default user is specified for the category and a bug is not pre-assigned
 * Enhancement: automatic defaults for $g_path and $g_absolute_path rather than dummy values.  This should avoid the need of redefining these values in config_inc.php and also support multiple domains.
 * Enhancement: bugs can be marked private
 * Enhancement: bug change history
 * Enhancement: caching of much DB data to prevent multiple requests for the same information
 * Enhancement: Cleaned up file uploading with better error messages and hiding file upload when it's disabled in PHP

 * Enhancement: make br, hr, li, img, selected, checked, and other html elements XHTML compliant
 * Enhancement: more visual graph pages in summary_page.php. Caution, old versions of JPGraph may cause problems, use v1.6.3 or above if you can.
 * Enhancement: news can now be made private
 * Enhancement: offer multiple group bug actions in view_all_bug_page.php
 * Enhancement: private bugnotes. At present these bugnotes are omitted from sent emails, a future release will put private bugnotes in emails to those who should see them.

 * Enhancement: reminder feature to let you send a message about a bug to a list of users
 * Enhancement: reworked BCTimer class to be more useful for debugging
 * Enhancement: send Bug History in e-mails
 * Enhancement: added new database upgrade system to allow you to easily apply database schema changes when  upgrading.
 * Enhancement: support uploading attachments to an FTP server (so now there is DISK, DATABASE, and FTP).  Recently uploaded/downloaded attachments are cached at the web server.
 * Enhancement: User names are now auto-generated for accounts that no longer exists.  The user names are prefixed by the string given in the config option prefix_for_deleted_users.
 * Enhancement: user_api.php, login.php and login_page.php send the user back to the referring page after login
 * Enhancement: warn the user if his browser does not support cookies, either because it's too old or because it was disabled

 * Enhancement: you can monitor bugs even when not reporter or handler
 * Enhancement: support for custom fields.
