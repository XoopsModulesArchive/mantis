* PROBLEM: Cannot login.  It just redirects me to the login page with no errors
or messages.

	SOLUTION 1: You may have track_vars set to Off (or 0).  Set this to On in
	your php3.ini or (php.ini) file.  As of version 4.0.3 it is permanently set
	to On.

	SOLUTION 2: You may not have DES installed on your system.  As a direct
	result the crypt() funtion may not work properly.  If possible install DES
	encryption support for your operating system.  Otherwise you will need to
	either reinstall or manually convert passwords over to another supported
	encryption system.

	SOLUTION 4: You do not have cookies enablewd in your browser.  You must
	have cookies enabled.  Sometimes, especially after an upgrade, you may
	have to delete your previous cookies.

	SOLUTION 5: You are using crypt() but your operating system is really
	calling MD5 instead.  Set the config_inc.php variable $g_login_method to
	MD5.  You may also have to replace the database passwords with MD5
	passwords.  See the bottom of sql/db_generate.sql for details.
