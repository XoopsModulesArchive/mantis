*********************************************
*** ALWAYS MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR DATABASE ***
*********************************************

Generally, you can just copy over the current installation.  You may want to
backup up any customizations that you may have made.  
Database modifications will occur only between significant releases (like 0.14.x to 0.15.0).

An automated database upgrade script was added in 0.18.0. This script (which can be accessed from
admin/index.php) will keep track of the current state of your database and allow you to
convert it to the current version. Make a backup of your database, just in case.

If you are converting from 0.17.x or older, you may have escaped quotes in your databases. If you
see escaped quotes (e.g. \') anywhere in your Mantis installation (after upgrading), run the
string escaping fix which can be found through admin/index.php.
