This document describes the changes to mantis that I made for integration
into the Xoops 2 CMS (Content Management System).  This work is an
'unofficial' modification by myself, so please do not contact the mantis
team regarding problems that you may discover.

Note that upgrading may not be very easy.  (i.e. How to merge mantis
changes with my modifications.)  If I have time I will try
to keep up to date with new releases of mantis, but for now only this
version (0.18.0a4) exists in modularized form.

I cannot offer direct support for this module.  If you have a have problems
installing after reading the documentation, please post on the forums
on www.xoops.org (on a modules forum) and clearly indicate it is for the
Mantis Bug Tracker module.  If I don't resond within a few days, feel
free to send me a private message on www.xoops.org.  Please do not contact
the mantis team.  (Unless of course you have questions how to use the
features of Mantis itself.)

2003-05-05 - bugfix: include/search.inc.php, line 15,
append $g_mantis_user_table, $g_queries_array to the list of globals

2003-05-06 - admin icon: created by w4z004, added in images/mantis_slogo.png;

Instructions:
------------

FRESH INSTALL:

- Just install as normally for an xoops module.


FROM PREVIOUS MANTIS INSTALL (UNTESTED!!):

- Dump the database to an sql file.
- Copy this file over /modules/mantis/sql/xoops_db_generate.sql
- Install as normal xoops module.
- (Optional) Revert original /modules/mantis/sql/xoops_db_generate.sql

XOOPS 2 THEMES ARE A LITTLE INCONSISTENT:

- works out of the box for 'default' theme
- for 'x2t' theme, in themes/x2t/theme.html, change <div class="content">
to <div id="content">
- for anything except default theme, insert the line <{$xoops_module_header}>
just before the line: <script type="text/javascript"> in theme.html

Note: you need to enable the option to load from .html theme files
in Xoops Preferences (at least temporarily) to see the changes.



Summary:
-------

Tried to write in a very generic way (at slight expense of speed)
so that mantis can be integrated into other CMS very easily.
I have implemented integration for Xoops 2 only.

Database is (optionally) integrated.  Note the CMS must use a
mysql database to be compatible.  There is no error checking for
this.  For xoops, there is currently no option to NOT integrate.

User authentication is integrated with CMS (takes the userNAME).
This makes compatible with prior existing mantis installation,
provided the same usernames are used/created in CMS.  For xoops,
there is currently no option to NOT integrate.

You can give admin access to the module from xoops.  This will assign
access_level to value ADMINISTRATOR.  If they are demoted in xoops,
the user returns to the default level.  Note: individual project
access_level values will NOT change.

Anonymous settings are overridden depending on xoops permissions.
You may define the anonymous username in mantis though.

The email address is taken from mantis account if defined; otherwise
the xoops profile is consulted.

Search is integrated for Xoops 2.

Language is integrated.  Language is set to xoops site default
(if possible), but users can override in their preferences.

Support for admin to create/change accounts is left in.  This
lets an admin create a user before someone logs in via xoops
(e.g. to give higher than default access).  To change a username
the name should be changed in both xoops in mantis.  If not,
then a NEW user is created on next login from xoops.

If the CMS provides user authentication, the admin pages are
protected.  Currently they redirect to main_page, and do not
display any message.  (Since redirect functions not loaded for
admin pages.)

User menu has option for 'Logout' removed, if CMS user system
is integrated.  In its place, a link to the home page of the CMS
is inserted.  If user has admin access, then a link to the admin
pages is provided as well.


FIXME / TODO:
------------

- Rethink the global definition of xoopsModule for system modules, etc.
If we set the global we might be breaking other things in xoops.  Maybe
we should define some new variables which point to same thing?

- Following the mantis coding style more closely... in particular,
variable names, no ?: constructs, etc...
http://mantisbt.sourceforge.net/guidelines.php3

- Xoops 2 Themes have different identifiers for content!!!  default
uses <div id="content"> and x2t uses <div class="content">.  Why?
Anyways, this screws up style.  Need changes in css/xoops_default.css,
admin/xoops_admin.css, admin/css/xoops_css_inc.php, and core/module_api.php.

- Probably is stuff I missed, especially with regard to login/logout
scripts.  (Especially if these URLs typed into address bar.)
Authentication cookie is no longer used - does this break anything?

- Could speed up include of core/module_api.php if skip some function
definitions depending on whether the feature is supported.

- May be an issue of ob_start() and some confusion because mantis
header split into two parts, and not consistent with admin either.

- Not tested whether works with integrated features (display, database,
and users) turned off.

- Integrate email SENDING (if provided by CMS) so don't need to
duplicate configuration efforts

- In several places, globals are declared, but I am not sure exactly
which ones are needed and which are extraneous

- In a few places, we do not have true module-type independence...
i.e. selection of CSS files is sometimes hardcoded with 'xoops' in
filename
